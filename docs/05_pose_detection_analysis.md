## Research Findings

### Squat Analysis Best Practices

Based on biomechanical research and MediaPipe documentation:

1. **Depth Detection**:

   - Hip crease below knee cap (hip-to-knee angle analysis)
   - Y-coordinate comparison between hip and knee landmarks
   - Depth percentage calculation for progressive feedback

2. **Bar Path Tracking**:

   - Shoulder midpoint tracking (landmarks 11, 12)
   - Vertical deviation measurement from ideal straight path
   - Real-time visualization overlay

3. **Lateral Shift Detection**:

   - Bilateral comparison of hip/knee positions
   - Maximum deviation detection at bottom position
   - Weight distribution analysis

4. **Tempo Tracking**:
   - Eccentric/concentric phase detection via velocity
   - Time-based analysis of movement phases
   - Joint angle velocity calculations

### MediaPipe Optimization for Squats

**Recommended Configuration**:

```typescript
{
  modelAssetPath: 'pose_landmarker_lite.task', // Best balance for real-time
  delegate: 'GPU', // with CPU fallback
  runningMode: 'VIDEO',
  numPoses: 1,
  minPoseDetectionConfidence: 0.7, // Higher for exercise analysis
  minPosePresenceConfidence: 0.7,
  minTrackingConfidence: 0.7,
  outputSegmentationMasks: false // Not needed for form analysis
}
```

**Critical Landmarks for Squat Analysis**:

- Shoulders: 11, 12 (bar position)
- Hips: 23, 24 (depth reference)
- Knees: 25, 26 (depth calculation)
- Ankles: 27, 28 (stability base)

**Performance Considerations**:

- Use Web Workers for processing
- Frame-selective processing (maintain 30 FPS)
- Implement landmark smoothing for noise reduction
- Cache angle calculations between frames

## Architecture Recommendations

### Phase 1: Extract Common Logic

**Objective**: Eliminate code duplication while maintaining performance

**Implementation**:

1. Create `BasePoseDetector` class with common MediaPipe logic
2. Extract shared utilities:
   - `LandmarkCalculator` for angles and distances
   - `PerformanceMonitor` for metrics tracking
   - `LandmarkValidator` for pose validation

### Phase 2: Implement Strategy Pattern

**Objective**: Create extensible exercise analysis system

**Core Interfaces**:

```typescript
interface ExerciseAnalyzer {
  analyzeFrame(landmarks: PoseLandmarkerResult): ExerciseMetrics;
  getConfiguration(): ExerciseConfig;
  validatePose(landmarks: PoseLandmarkerResult): boolean;
}

interface ExerciseMetrics {
  exercise: ExerciseType;
  confidence: number;
  isValidPose: boolean;
  specificMetrics: SquatMetrics | BenchMetrics | DeadliftMetrics;
}
```

**Exercise-Specific Analyzers**:

- `SquatAnalyzer` - depth, bar path, lateral shift
- `BenchPressAnalyzer` - chest-bar distance, press path, elbow tracking
- `DeadliftAnalyzer` - hip hinge mechanics, bar tracking, back angle

### Phase 3: Plugin Architecture

**Objective**: Support dynamic exercise addition and configuration

**Core Components**:

1. `ExerciseAnalysisEngine` - coordinates detection and analysis
2. `ExercisePluginManager` - handles plugin registration/loading
3. `ExerciseConfigManager` - manages hierarchical configuration

**Benefits**:

- Easy addition of new exercises
- Isolated testing and development
- Runtime configuration switching
- Maintainable codebase

### Phase 4: Multi-Exercise Support

**Recommended Exercise Progression**:

1. **Squat** (Current) - Foundation exercise
2. **Bench Press** - Upper body tracking, different camera angle
3. **Deadlift** - Hip hinge movement, full body coordination

**Shared Infrastructure**:

- Common pose detection pipeline
- Shared UI components for metrics display
- Unified error handling and logging
- Consistent performance monitoring

- Implement comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Add runtime validation with Zod schemas

- Integration tests for complete analysis pipeline
- Performance benchmarks for real-time requirements
- User acceptance testing for form feedback accuracy

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Workflow

### Why TDD is Ideal for This Project

**TDD provides significant benefits** for this pose detection refactoring:

1. **Complex Mathematical Logic**: Joint angle calculations, distance measurements, and form analysis algorithms are perfect for TDD
2. **Performance-Critical Code**: Real-time requirements (30 FPS) demand reliable, fast code with regression protection
3. **Refactoring Safety**: Moving from two services to plugin architecture requires confidence that existing functionality works
4. **Multi-Exercise Expansion**: Adding new exercises risks breaking existing analysis - tests prevent this

### TDD Implementation Strategy

#### Test Pyramid Structure

- **Unit Tests (70%)**: Mathematical calculations, utility functions
- **Integration Tests (20%)**: Exercise analyzers with mock data
- **E2E Tests (10%)**: Full camera-to-analysis pipeline

#### Testing Tools

- **Vitest**: Fast unit testing (already in stack)
- **React Testing Library**: UI component testing
- **Playwright**: E2E testing with real camera input
- **Benchmark.js**: Performance regression testing

#### Test Data Management

```typescript
// Create fixture data for consistent testing
const MOCK_SQUAT_LANDMARKS = {
  good_depth: {
    /* landmarks for proper depth */
  },
  shallow: {
    /* landmarks for shallow squat */
  },
  lateral_shift: {
    /* landmarks showing imbalance */
  },
};
```

### TDD Workflow by Phase

#### Phase 1: Extract Common Logic (Perfect for TDD)

**Red-Green-Refactor Cycle:**

```typescript
// 1. RED: Write failing test
describe('LandmarkCalculator', () => {
  it('should calculate knee angle correctly', () => {
    const hip = { x: 0.5, y: 0.3, z: 0 };
    const knee = { x: 0.5, y: 0.5, z: 0 };
    const ankle = { x: 0.5, y: 0.7, z: 0 };

    expect(LandmarkCalculator.calculateAngle(hip, knee, ankle)).toBeCloseTo(180, 1);
  });
});
```

#### Phase 2: Strategy Pattern (Interface-Driven Development)

```typescript
// Define interfaces first through tests
describe('ExerciseAnalyzer', () => {
  it('should implement required interface methods', () => {
    const analyzer = new SquatAnalyzer();
    expect(analyzer.analyzeFrame).toBeDefined();
    expect(analyzer.getConfiguration).toBeDefined();
    expect(analyzer.validatePose).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

#### Phase 3: Plugin Architecture (Test-Driven)

```typescript
describe('ExercisePluginManager', () => {
  it('should register and load plugins correctly', () => {
    const manager = new ExercisePluginManager();
    const plugin = new SquatAnalyzerPlugin();

    manager.register('squat', plugin);
    expect(manager.getAnalyzer('squat')).toBe(plugin);
  });
});
```

### Handling TDD Challenges

#### Challenge 1: MediaPipe Integration

**Solution**: Dependency injection and mocking

```typescript
class MockPoseLandmarker {
  detectForVideo(video: HTMLVideoElement) {
    return this.mockResult;
  }
}
```

#### Challenge 2: Performance Testing

**Solution**: Separate performance tests

```typescript
describe('Performance', () => {
  it('should process frame within 33ms', () => {
    const start = performance.now();
    analyzer.analyzeFrame(mockLandmarks);
    const duration = performance.now() - start;

    expect(duration).toBeLessThan(33); // 30 FPS requirement
  });
});
```

#### Challenge 3: Visual Component Testing

**Solution**: Test data generation, not rendering

```typescript
describe('OverlayGenerator', () => {
  it('should generate correct bar path overlay points', () => {
    const overlayData = generateBarPathOverlay(shoulderHistory);
    expect(overlayData.points).toHaveLength(shoulderHistory.length);
  });
});
```

## Conclusion

**Recommendation**: Both services are necessary but should be restructured.

1. **Keep OptimizedPoseDetector** as the foundation but refactor it into a base class
2. **Enhance SquatPoseAnalyzer** by removing duplicated logic and focusing on squat-specific analysis
3. **Implement the plugin architecture** to support future exercises efficiently
4. **Maintain performance** by sharing the underlying MediaPipe instance across analyzers

This approach provides:

- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of bench press and deadlift analysis
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Performance**: Shared optimizations across exercises
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with exercise-specific metrics
- **Testability**: Isolated, mockable components

The architecture supports the project's goals of being a comprehensive powerlifting analysis tool while maintaining the technical excellence expected for real-time performance.
