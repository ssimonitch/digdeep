# DigDeep Post-MVP Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the future development path for DigDeep after the MVP is complete. It includes architectural improvements, feature enhancements, and technical optimizations organized by priority and dependencies.

**MVP Foundation**: This roadmap assumes the MVP implementation (real-time squat analysis with visual feedback) is complete and working reliably.

> **Architecture Reference**: See [Pose Detection Services Analysis](./reference/pose_detection_analysis.md) for detailed technical implementation guidance, TDD methodology, and architectural patterns that inform this roadmap.

## Don't Close Doors During MVP

### Critical Design Decisions

When building the MVP, make these choices to enable future expansion:

#### 1. **Use Interfaces Even with Single Implementation**

```typescript
// Good - enables future exercises
interface ExerciseAnalyzer {
  analyzeFrame(landmarks: PoseLandmarkerResult): ExerciseMetrics;
}

class SquatAnalyzer implements ExerciseAnalyzer {
  // implementation
}

// Avoid - hard to extend
class SquatAnalyzer {
  // direct implementation
}
```

#### 2. **Separate Analysis Logic from UI**

- Keep pose analysis in services/workers
- Pass data to UI components via props/hooks
- Avoid tight coupling between analysis and display

#### 3. **Design Extensible Data Structures**

```typescript
// Good - can add exercises without breaking
interface AnalysisResult {
  exercise: 'squat' | 'bench' | 'deadlift';
  timestamp: number;
  metrics: SquatMetrics | BenchMetrics | DeadliftMetrics;
}

// Avoid - locked to squats
interface SquatResult {
  depth: number;
  balance: number;
}
```

#### 4. **Maintain Clear Module Boundaries**

- Services handle business logic
- Components handle presentation
- Hooks manage state and effects
- Utils contain pure functions
