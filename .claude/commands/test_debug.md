We still have some tests failing. Let's evaluate one at a time starting with:            â”‚
                                                                                            
   @src/features/analysis/components/__tests__/ActiveAnalysisScreen.integration.test.tsx    
                                                                                            
   Review the tests that are failing and evaluate:                                          
                                                                                            
   1. are these test cases valid thing to test for given our expectations of what           
   @src/features/analysis/components/ActiveAnalysisScreen.tsx  does?                        
                                                                                            
   2. if the answer to the above is "yes", then is there a bug with the implementation of   
   ActiveAnalysisScreen that we need to fix? Or is there an issue with the test             
   implementation? First validate the test implementation, then evaluate the component      
   implementation.                                                                          
                                                                                            
   3. We appear to have multiple test files related to this component:                      
                                                                                            
   @src/features/analysis/components/__tests__/ActiveAnalysisScreen.pose-gating.test.tsx    
   @src/features/analysis/components/__tests__/ActiveAnalysisScreen.integration.test.tsx    
   @src/features/analysis/components/__tests__/ActiveAnalysisScreen.test.tsx                
                                                                                            
   are all of these needed? If there are redundencies, can they be combined?                
                                                                                            
   Remember to use vitest best practices and use context7 to refer to documentation if      
   necessary.                                                                               
                                                                                            
   Remember, we are ONLY working on ActiveScreenAnalysis right now. Do not evaluate other   
   services or tests.
